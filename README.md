# CS50's Harvard Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository include all the exercises made during the Harvard Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python Course.

During the course, we pass through themes like:

- Search
- Knowledge
- Uncertainty
- Optimization
- Learning
- Neural Networks
- Language


## Search 
Graph search algorithms (depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A*) and adversarial search algorithms (minimax).
### Degrees
Using search algorithms we try to find the distance in a relationship between persons in hollywood.

### Tic Tac Toe
Using adversarial search algorithm, we create an AI to play tic-tac-toe.

## Knowledge
Using logical knowledge to resolve problems with representations (propositional and first-order logic), knowledge agents, model checking, inferences and etc.

### Knights
Using propositional logic and knowledge to validate sentences

### Mineswepper
Using knowledge base and knowledge base agents to resolve problems.

## Uncertainty
Using probability to resolve problems where you dont have certanty, prediction using Markov and Hidden Markov models.

### Heredity
Using probability to calculate the percentage to a person have an trait, based on the parents.

### Pagerank
Using probability to calculate pagerank probability based on page mentions.

## Optimization
Local search algorithms (hill climbing and simulated annealing), linear programming algorithms (simplex, interior point), and constraint satisfaction algorithms (AC-3, backtracking search, maintaining arc consistency).

### Crossword
Solve crossword problems using arc consistency and backtrack.

## Learning
