- ⚙️ **Optimization**
- 🧬 **Learning**
- 🤖 **Neural Networks**
- 🖌️ **Language**

---

## 🎮 Search
Graph search algorithms (➡️ Depth-First Search, ⬆️ Breadth-First Search, 📊 A*) and adversarial search algorithms (🔁 Minimax).

### 🏋️‍♂️ Degrees
Using search algorithms to find the relationship distance between people in Hollywood.

### ◯ Tic Tac Toe
Creating an AI to play tic-tac-toe using adversarial search algorithms.

---

## 🔧 Knowledge
Leveraging logical knowledge to solve problems through representations (propositional and first-order logic), knowledge agents, model checking, and inferences.

### 🧩 Knights
Using propositional logic to validate sentences.

### 🔵 Minesweeper
Applying knowledge bases and agents to solve Minesweeper problems.

## ❓ Uncertainty
Using probability to handle situations with incomplete information, including prediction through Markov and Hidden Markov models.

### 👶 Heredity
Calculating the likelihood of a person having a specific trait based on parental information.

### 🔗 Pagerank
Using probability to calculate PageRank based on page mentions and links.

---

## ⚙️ Optimization
Exploring optimization through:
- Local search algorithms (hill climbing and simulated annealing).
- Linear programming (simplex, interior point).
- Constraint satisfaction (AC-3, backtracking search, maintaining arc consistency).

### ✉ Crossword
Solving crossword puzzles using arc consistency and backtracking algorithms.

---

## 🧬 Learning
Building AI agents that can learn and make decisions using rewards and calculations.

### ♟ Nim
Developing an AI agent that learns to play the game of Nim.

### 🛍️ Shopping
Creating an AI agent that predicts shopping purchases based on customer behavior.

---

## 🤖 Neural Networks
Training and applying neural networks using the Google TensorFlow library.

### 🚗 Traffic
Recognizing traffic plates using neural networks with TensorFlow and OpenCV.

---

## 🖌️ Language
Training AI to understand language patterns using Context-Free Grammar (CFG) with NLTK and neural networks with the attention mechanism.

### 🔗 CFG Parser
Using NLTK to understand grammar patterns and concepts.

### 🎨 Attention
Predicting masked words in phrases using neural networks with attention mechanisms (as used in large language models).
